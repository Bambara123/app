# Superwall React Native Vibe Coding Guide
This is an all-in-one prompt to get the Superwall SDK set up in your app.

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the Superwall Docs MCP. If you don't have it, ask me to add it, and refer me to the docs: [https://superwall.com/docs/sdk/guides/vibe-coding](https://superwall.com/docs/sdk/guides/vibe-coding)

## Integration Steps

1. Install the Superwall SDK
2. Configure it with my API key: `pk_x1oemCKfj86tcZHplNWlr`
3. Present a paywall
4. Set up deep link handling
5. Ask me about how I want to handle these two items:

* Identifying the user
* Setting user attributes

## How to Implement a Step

Implement each step one at a time. For each step, do the following:

* Before starting, get context using the Superwall Docs MCP. Use it as the only source of truth for Superwall knowledge.
* Then, help me implement the step as described in the Superwall Docs MCP response,
* If needed, ask me for project-specific clarification.
* Finally, test the step or instruct me on how to test it.
* Explain to me what you did, what step is complete, and what step is next.
