value screens -

Smart Reminders -  allows adult children to create reminders for mom/dad. When the parents aging, they might have tendency to forget things more often like medicine, meals exercising etc.
adult child can add reminder to ring/when the right time arrives. 
Location tracking -  Realtime the adult child can see where the parent is.
Battery tracking - child can see the status of parents battery. so if no reply he can think battery is gone/no need to worry thinking that mom/dad is trouble.
Chat -  Have conversation endless with mom/dad share anything
In emergency -  mom/ dad can send quick alarm in one click.
album - moments/ photo sharing wall embedded into app that users can see and enjoy their relationship with mom/dad. (keep mom/dad happy)


These are the feature in my app when point of view of adult child. I need 4/5 value screens with good flow.
